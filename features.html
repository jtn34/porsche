        <h1>Aerodynamics and Design</h1>
        <h4>Downforce update.</h4>
        <p>The new 911 GT3 RS is set up for performance – thanks to increased downforce and revised aerodynamics. Using all vehicle data, including longitudinal/lateral acceleration, accelerator/brake pedal position and friction values, even the position of the rear wing and front diffuser are automatically adjusted to the driving situation in split seconds by Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA) with DRS. Best prerequisites for the next flying lap.</p>
        <h4>S-Duct front with single-cooler concept.</h4>
        <p>Like the GT racing cars, the new 911 GT3 RS has a single, large center radiator in place of the front trunk. The S-shaped air guide gives the concept its name. The concept ensures improved aerodynamics in terms of downforce and brake cooling compared to the two side coolers and the small center cooler that are otherwise used.</p>
        <h4>Wide turbo body with air intake.</h4>
        <p>The wide turbo body with air intake panel significantly contributes to the aerodynamic optimization of the 911 GT3 RS and reinforces the athletic appearance. It also opens up space for new, wider wheels that improve handling even further.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="lightweight">
        <h1>Lightweight Construction</h1>
        <h4>Thrilling lightness.</h4>
        <p>The highest maxim in lightweight construction: Reduce to the maximum. The new 911 GT3 RS also remains true to this motorsport philosophy – despite the significantly expanded and further improved equipment compared to its predecessors, including the active aerodynamics, wider wheels and tires, wider body and more extensive adjustment options for the chassis in different driving modes.</p>
        <h4>Carbon fiber.</h4>
        <p>The consistent use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) enables a curb weight of just 3268 lbs. The fenders, front lid in a specific RS shape and roof are all made of motorsport-tested materials. The CFRP rear wing with active aerodynamics, CFRP doors for optimized wheel arch vents, and aluminum and magnesium lightweight forged wheels also yield significant advantages on the race track.</p>
        <h4>Exterior.</h4>
        <p>In a battle for performance, every gram counts. The optional Weissach package reduces the weight by approximately 33 lbs. The front lid, roof and exterior mirror top half in visible high gloss carbon fiber, and the rear wing in partial high gloss carbon fiber sharpen the motorsport character of the new 911 GT3 RS.</p>
        <h4>Interior.</h4>
        <p>The fine tuning continues with the lightweight PDK gearshift paddles made of magnesium, a dashboard upper section covered with Black Race-Tex, interior elements in a satin carbon fiber-weave finish, a badge with the "Weissach RS" logo on the passenger side and headrests with the "Weissach RS" embroidered logo.</p>
        <h4>Chassis.</h4>
        <p>The anti-roll bars on the front and rear axles, coupling rods on the rear axle and the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) shear panel also provide the ideal weight on the way to new personal bests.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="performance">
        <h1>Performance</h1>
        <h4>Maximum performance.</h4>
        <p>As soon as the lights give the starting signal, the new 911 GT3 RS delivers unbelievable performance of up to 342 lb-ft on the racetrack. With up to 518 hp, taking you from 0-60 mph in 3.0 seconds, it can reach a top track speed of 184 mph. The lightweight stainless steel sport exhaust system ensures an unfiltered sound experience up to a maximum of 9,000 rpm.</p>
        <h4>Engine.</h4>
        <p>Modern motorsport technology sets the tone in the 4.0-liter high revving naturally aspirated engine: 4-valve technology including rocker arms and rigid valve drive, as well as forged pistons and titanium connecting rods. The oil supply is optimized and ready for high lateral forces, thanks to dry sump lubrication with a separate engine oil tank.</p>
        <h4>Increased antidive.</h4>
        <p>Ambitious drivers know that precise deceleration is just as important as powerful acceleration. Improved aero balance when braking is achieved by an optimized chassis geometry reducing the deflection of the front axle.</p>
        <h4>Lateral dynamics.</h4>
        <p>The new 911 GT3 RS reduces the need to brake before bends and chicanes to a minimum. The ultra high performance (UHP) tires with 275/35 R20 at the front and 335/30 R21 at the rear, new wider wheels and wider track provide more lateral dynamics and higher cornering speeds.</p>
        <h4>Porsche Active Suspension Management.</h4>
        <p>The electronic adjustment of the damping control system actively and continuously adjusts the damping force on each wheel, based on current road conditions and driving style. PASM has two settings: sporty-comfortable and sporty-firm.</p>
        <h4>Brakes.</h4>
        <p>The 911 GT3 RS already has a particularly powerful brake system as standard – which has been optimized again for use on the race track: with 6-piston aluminum brake calipers painted in Red at the front and 4-piston aluminum brake calipers at the rear in monobloc construction for high dimensional stability and very good response and release of the brakes. The lowered and internally vented compound brake discs reduce the unsprung and rotating masses and thus the weight, thanks to their two-part design with aluminum brake chambers.</p>
